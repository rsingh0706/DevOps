# Docker images

1. How many images are available on this host?

2. What is the size of the ubuntu image?

3. We just pulled a new image. What is the tag on the newly pulled NGINX image?

4. We just downloaded the code of an application. What is the base image used in the Dockerfile?

5. To what location within the container is the application code copied to during a Docker build?

6. When a container is created using the image built with this Dockerfile, what is the command used to RUN the application inside it.

7. What port is the web application run within the container?

8. Build a docker image using the Dockerfile and name it webapp-color. No tag to be specified.

9. Run an instance of the image webapp-color and publish port 8080 on the container to 8282 on the host.

10. Access the application by clicking on the tab named HOST:8282 above your terminal.

11. What is the base Operating System used by the python:3.6 image?

12. What is the approximate size of the webapp-color image?

13. Build a new smaller docker image by modifying the same Dockerfile and name it webapp-color and tag it lite.

14. Run an instance of the new image webapp-color:lite and publish port 8080 on the container to 8383 on the host.

# Labs - Environment Variables

1. Inspect the environment variables set on the running container and identify the value set to the APP_COLOR variable.

2. Run a container named blue-app using image kodekloud/simple-webapp and set the environment variable APP_COLOR to blue. Make the application available on port 38282 on the host. The application listens on port 8080.

3. View the application by clicking the link HOST:38282 above your terminal and ensure it has the right color.

4. Deploy a mysql database using the mysql image and name it mysql-db.


Set the database password to use db_pass123. Lookup the mysql image on Docker Hub and identify the correct environment variable to use for setting the root password.

1. Dockerfiles for a few commonly used Docker Images are given in the /root (current) directory. Inspect them and try to answer the following questions.

2. What is the ENTRYPOINT configured on the mysql image?

3. What is the CMD configured on the wordpress image?

4. What is the final command run at startup when the wordpress image is run. Consider both ENTRYPOINT and CMD instructions

5. What is the command run at startup when the ubuntu image is run?

6. Run an instance of the ubuntu image to run the sleep 1000 command at startup.
