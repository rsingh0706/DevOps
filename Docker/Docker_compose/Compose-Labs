1. First create a redis database container called redis, image redis:alpine.

2. Next, create a simple container called clickcounter with the image kodekloud/click-counter, link it to the redis container that we created in the previous task and then expose it on the host port 8085

3. You can now access this application using the Click-Counter tab above the terminal.

4. Let's clean up the actions carried out in previous steps. Delete the redis and the clickcounter containers.

5. Create a docker-compose.yml file under the directory /root/clickcounter. Once done, run docker-compose up.

The compose file should have the exact specification as follows -

redis service specification - Image name should be redis:alpine.
clickcounter service specification - Image name should be kodekloud/click-counter, app is run on port 5000 and expose it on the host port 8085 in the compose file.
